# Bio
Hi! I am Biraj Silwal, developer of myLobo app. I'm a junior studying computer science and mathematics at UNM. In my free time I enjoy competitive programming, creating mobile apps, and attending online hackathones. I am passionate about techology and also interested in Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, and Robotics. 

# Other supporting information
1. For the best experinece please use latest version of android operating system. **API level more than 25** is highly recommended. 
2. After you login for the first time, it might take little bit longer to load contents in Marketplace and myLobos. So, you might have to wait ~10 seconds. Sorry, for an inconvinience.
